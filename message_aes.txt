From the wreckage of the galleon *The Sentinel*, where the silent current flows, our journey begins.

Follow the shimmering current three leagues north, past the jagged isles of Lost Frames. 
Steer by the Northern Star's constant pulse, not the flickering beacons of the false ports, for they are traps.

When the shadow of Mount Latency looms on the horizon, turn your prow to face it. 
You must navigate the Churning Straits where packets are lost to the deep. 
Many a vessel has been swallowed whole here. Keep your heading true.

Beware the Siren's call of the Corrupted Sectors, for their song promises shortcuts but leads only to the abyss.

Beyond the straits lies an island, cloaked in a perpetual fog of discarded bits. The entrance is hidden. 
Seek a cave mouth shrouded by a waterfall of cascading light, where the data runs cold to the touch.

Inside, the Cache of Captain Blackwood awaits the one with the nerve to claim it.
