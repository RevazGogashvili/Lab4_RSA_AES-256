RSA and AES are two of the most widely used encryption algorithms today, but they are fundamentally different and are designed to solve different problems. 
RSA is an asymmetric algorithm (using a public/private key pair), while AES is a symmetric algorithm (using a single shared key). They are not competitors; in modern systems, they are partners.

This document outlines their key differences in performance and use cases, as demonstrated by the practical exercises in this assignment.



1.  **Cryptography Model (Symmetric vs. Asymmetric)**
    *   **RSA (Asymmetric):** Uses a pair of keys that are mathematically linked: a public key and a private key.
        - The public key can be shared with anyone and is used for ENCRYPTION.
        - The private key must be kept secret and is used for DECRYPTION.
        - This model is powerful for establishing communication with someone you've never met, as you only need their public key to send them a secure message.

    *   **AES (Symmetric):** Uses a single secret key for both ENCRYPTION and DECRYPTION.
        - The same key that locks the data is the one that unlocks it.
        - This requires both the sender and receiver to have a copy of the same secret key beforehand. The secure distribution of this key is a major challenge, which RSA often helps solve.


2.  **Performance (Speed)**
    *   **RSA (Slow):** RSA's operations are based on complex mathematical problems involving large prime numbers (modular exponentiation). These calculations are computationally intensive and, therefore, significantly slower.
    
    *   **AES (Extremely Fast):** AES operates on simpler, faster algebraic principles (like substitution and permutation) on fixed-size blocks of data. It is designed to be highly efficient and can be implemented directly in hardware, making it orders of magnitude faster than RSA.
    
    *   **Conclusion:** AES is the clear choice for encrypting large amounts of data where speed is a concern. RSA is too slow for this purpose.


3.  **Data Size Limitation**
    *   **RSA (Strictly Limited):** As demonstrated in this assignment, RSA can only encrypt a small block of data, the size of which is determined by its key length (minus padding). For a 2048-bit key, this limit is around 214 bytes. It is fundamentally incapable of encrypting a large file on its own.

    *   **AES (No Practical Limit):** AES is a block cipher that encrypts data in 16-byte chunks. To handle data of any size, it uses a "mode of operation" (like CBC, which we used). This mode securely chains the blocks together, allowing AES to encrypt files of any size, from kilobytes to terabytes.


Based on the strengths and weaknesses above, each algorithm has a very specific job in modern security.

**When to Use RSA:**
Because it is slow but excellent at proving identity and establishing secure communication, RSA is used for tasks that happen infrequently but are critical for security setup.
*   **Secure Key Exchange:** This is its most common use. It is used to encrypt a symmetric key (like an AES key) to send it securely to another party. This is the foundation of Hybrid Encryption.
*   **Digital Signatures:** The private key can be used to "sign" a document or message. This signature can be verified by anyone with the public key, proving the message came from the owner of the private key and has not been altered.

**When to Use AES:**
Because it is incredibly fast and can handle bulk data, AES is the workhorse for encrypting the data itself.
*   **File and Disk Encryption:** Encrypting files on your hard drive (e.g., BitLocker, FileVault).
*   **Network Communication Security:** Securing the data sent over the internet (e.g., in HTTPS/TLS, securing your Wi-Fi with WPA2/WPA3).
*   **Database Encryption:** Protecting sensitive information stored in databases.

In practice, RSA and AES are used together in a "hybrid encryption" model that combines the best of both worlds:

1.  To send a large, encrypted file, you first generate a brand new, random **AES key**.
2.  You use this fast **AES key** to encrypt your large file.
3.  You then use the recipient's slow but secure **RSA public key** to encrypt only the small AES key.
4.  You send both the AES-encrypted file and the RSA-encrypted AES key to the recipient.
5.  The recipient uses their **RSA private key** to quickly decrypt the AES key, and then uses that **AES key** to quickly decrypt the large file.

This method gives you the convenience of public-key cryptography (RSA) and the performance of symmetric cryptography (AES).
